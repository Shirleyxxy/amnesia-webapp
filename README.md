## Web App Demonstration of Amnesia

This web app serves to demonstrate the decremental update procedures for an item-based collaborative filtering model. Specifically, the web app will display the corresponding changes of history matrix, cooccurrence matrix, and item similarity matrix after removing (i.e. “forgetting”) the data of a particular user.

#### Project Milestones

1. Illustrate the changes of the matrices given input JSON files.
2. Connect Differential Dataflow with the web app via Apache Kafka to display the real-time changes.
3. Create a user interface so that users can interact with the web app.
